      <description>Linux stores the configuration and settings in a dconf database that consists of a single file in binary format. The format is defined as gvdb (GVariant Database file). It is a simple database file format that stores a mapping from strings to GVariant values in a way that is extremely efficient for lookups.
The GNOME database file for each user is by default ~/.config/dconf/user. To explore/edit the dconf database, you can use the dconf Editor.</description>

      <description>In Kotlin you have two types of constants, const and val.
const are compile time constants. Meaning, that their value has to be assigned during the compile time, unlike val, where it can be done at runtime. This means, that const can never be assigned to a function or any class constructor. Must be top-level, or member of an object declaration or a companion object.
Declarations:
const val foo = &amp;#34;Hello world&amp;#34; Examples:</description>

      <description>There are two package tools, apt and apt-get. apt is just the rework of apt-get.

      <description>One of the things that we always need to know when working with an operating system, is where the things are.
Repositories
The repositories are located in the folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.
Path
The $PATH is set in the file /etc/environment.
Desktop files
The *.desktop files are located in the folders ~/.local/share/applications/ and /usr/share/applications/.
Software installation folder
If you are installing software manually, for instance a software downloaded as a tar.gz file, should be installed in the folder /opt/.</description>

      <description>Well, this is my first blog. I always wanted to have one, but you know, never is the right moment to sit down and spend some time writing.
Finally, I decided to do it. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m aging and slowing down my pace of life a bit &amp;hellip; anyways, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll find here some useful posts.
