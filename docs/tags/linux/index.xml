      <description>Linux stores the configuration and settings in a dconf database that consists of a single file in binary format. The format is defined as gvdb (GVariant Database file). It is a simple database file format that stores a mapping from strings to GVariant values in a way that is extremely efficient for lookups.
The GNOME database file for each user is by default ~/.config/dconf/user. To explore/edit the dconf database, you can use the dconf Editor.</description>

The repositories are located in the folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.
Path
The $PATH is set in the file /etc/environment.
Desktop files
The *.desktop files are located in the folders ~/.local/share/applications/ and /usr/share/applications/.
Software installation folder
If you are installing software manually, for instance a software downloaded as a tar.gz file, should be installed in the folder /opt/.</description>
