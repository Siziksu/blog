One of the things that we always need to know when working with an operating system, is where the things are.

**Repositories**

The repositories are located in the folder `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`.

**Path**

The `$PATH` is set in the file `/etc/environment`.

**Desktop files**

The `*.desktop` files are located in the folders `~/.local/share/applications/` and `/usr/share/applications/`.

**Software installation folder**

If you are installing software manually, for instance a software downloaded as a `tar.gz` file, should be installed in the folder `/opt/`.
